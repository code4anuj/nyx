# NYX - Self Driving Delivery Robot

The Autonomous Delivery System works on delivery robots which are self communicating and self driving PODS, delivers the goods by passing packages to each other. A smart delivery system based on Self driven and self communicating robots will deliver the packages on time by passing goods to each others which will ultimately reduces delivery time. Self communicating can be used in tackling the emergency situations and tricky problems. Self Driving will be performed by integrating computer vision techniques with robotic hardware using predefined and self learning algorithms which will behave according to environment. 

Proof Of Concept Development Stage : \
We are working on the working on the Custom Road Segmentation Model which could perform better or equal to detectron2. The model is made from scratch to make the robot self driven on highway roads.
